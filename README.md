# CodeTweet-SQL-Backed-Command-Line-Interface

DESCRIPTION:
 The project aims to develop a system utilizing a SQLite database and a command line interface implemented in a host programming language, with Python as the preferred choice. Group collaboration is essential, with an expectation of equal contributions. The relational schema provided includes tables for users, follows, tweets, hashtags, mentions, retweets, lists, and includes.

The system's features encompass a login screen for both registered and unregistered users. Registered users can access tweets from followed users, compose replies, and retweet, while unregistered users can sign up and subsequently engage in various operations post-login. Functionalities involve searching for tweets and users using keywords, composing tweets, listing followers, and logging out.

String matching is case-insensitive for most operations, except for passwords, which must be case-sensitive. The system is required to guard against SQL injection attacks and ensure that password entry remains invisible during typing. Robust error checking is recommended to handle user input effectively and prevent system breakdowns caused by mistakes.

The project underscores the integration of SQL with a host programming language, with a focus on practical applications like user authentication, data retrieval, and user interaction via a command line interface.
